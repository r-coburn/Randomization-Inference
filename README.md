# Math420Proj
A Repository for Riley Coburn & Jake Caldwell's Statistical Modelling Final Project

Our project consists of expanding our knowledge on Randomization based inference. We will be using two texts, _Mathematical Stats with Resampling and R_ and _What Teachers Should know about the Bootstrap Resample_ and walk through a lengthy example that will cover multiple topics in resampling. We will also shed light on a little more background theory to why randomization based inferences work for statistics.
